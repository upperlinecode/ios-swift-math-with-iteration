//Here are a few math problems that are very difficult without iteration, but much easier once you add a nice for-in loop.
//Give these problems a shot. Try to make your code as simple as possible. If you are typing 100 lines for one of these problems,
//there is probably an easier way to do it.





//1. Big Sums
//The sum of the digits from 1 to 10 (1 + 2 + ... + 10) is 55
//Find the sum of the digits from 1 to 487





//2. Age in Seconds
//There are 51 students taking Intro to Swift. The age in years of each student is listed in the array 'ages'. Create a new array, agesInDays. It should contain their ages, but with the age in days instead of years. You can disregard leap years and assume every year is 365 days.
let ages = [15, 16, 16, 14, 17, 17, 14, 15, 15, 16, 17, 15, 17, 18, 15, 16, 17, 14, 15, 15, 16, 17, 16, 15, 16, 14, 18, 14, 18, 17, 15, 16, 14, 16, 16, 15, 17, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 16, 15, 15, 16, 15, 16, 14, 17, 17]






//3. Sum of Multiples
// The multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than or equal to 10 are: 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10. The sum of these multiples is 33.
//Find the sum of all of the multiples of 3 and 5 that are less than or equal to 1000000





//4. Difference of Squares
//The sum of the squares from 1 to 5 is (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2) = 55
//The square of the sum from 1 to 5 is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)^2 = 225
//The difference between the square of the sum from 1 to 5 and the sum of the squares from 1 to 5 is 225 - 55 = 170
//Find the difference between the square of the sum from 1 to 1000 and the sum of the squares from 1 to 1000
//Notice that the computer starts requiring a noticable amount of time to make this calculation. How large does the sequence have to
//become before it takes several seconds to iterate? (There is no right answer to this second question, just something to think about)
